EVELYN (Essential Variety Effector Lateralizing Your Noncompliance) is a Battle Facility Randoms roll assistant.

Currently accepted roll methods:
* repto (roll with duplicates)
* coeur (roll w/o  duplicates)
* asterisk (mark mon entries in roster.txt with asterisks; rolls without any of these are discarded; warning: every box must contain at least one asterisked entry in this case, or the program will re-roll in an endless loop (can be fixed by capping reroll attempts, and will soon be))
* asterisk-nodupl (as above, w/o duplicates)

Planned features:
* Quick generation of pasteables from larger roster by selecting four sets
* Log rolls for an entire run
* maybe a grading system, "rate your mons"
